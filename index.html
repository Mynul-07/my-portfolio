            <p>Whenever anyone think of career many people might have different choices and plan. Someone wants to
                become a
                doctor, Someone wants to become an engineer.I also had that type of plan. But ultimately I want to find
                out
                real
                sense of happiness. It's joy. It's playfulness. It's fun, It's non seriousness. When time stops I love
                What
                I am
                doing. It's what we all seek. But we try to find out in so many different ways. Some try to find out
                through
                money.But no types of paper it brings to us. Some try to find out achievement and success but they come
                up
                empty. It's in with us. It's a choice.</p>
